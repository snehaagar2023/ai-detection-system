Text:   We present a new numerical code, ECHO, based on an Eulerian Conservative High
Order scheme for time dependent three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and magnetodynamics (GRMD). ECHO is aimed at
providing a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrary
level of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD and
GRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is to
present a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing for
different sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a generic
space-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver for
Einstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implemented
and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation is
treated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures,
appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in
shock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as
force-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the
fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the
matter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate,
efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several
astrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of large
amplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves. In particular, we show that
reconstruction based on a Monotonicity Preserving filter applied to a fixed
5-point stencil gives highly accurate results for smooth solutions, both in
flat and curved metric (up to the nominal fifth order), while at the same time
providing sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities.

Text: We present an approach for minimizing distortion in Gaussian Layered Broadcast Coding with Successive Refinement. The motivation for this research stems from the practical need to transmit large amounts of data using limited transmission resources. In this context, broadcast coding is a well-known technique that can transmit a common message to multiple receivers in a single broadcast transmission, thereby reducing the necessary transmission bandwidth and power. However, in conventional broadcast coding, some receivers may have worse channel conditions, leading to increased distortion levels. Our proposed method utilizes successive refinement to minimize this distortion by introducing an adaptive refinement process for the source coding phase and using Gaussian Layered Broadcast Coding to adapt the channel coding phase to the receivers' channel quality.

The key idea is to optimize the transmission by allocating resources optimally between the source and channel coding phases. We leverage the coding gain from the adaptive refinement process to improve the performance while reducing the requirements for the channel coding resources. By applying Gaussian Layered Broadcast Coding to the channel coding, we encode information in multiple layers, where each receiver extracts the maximum number of layers possible with their channel quality.

Our work aims to address the problem of distortion caused by channel heterogeneity in conventional broadcast coding and provide a practical solution to minimize it. The proposed method achieves significant reduction in the distortion with the same transmission power and time, compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Our contributions offer significant potential for practical improvements in wireless communication systems.

Text: In this study, we investigate the reality of linear and angular momentum expectation values in bound states. The problem we aim to solve is the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of these expectation values. Our objective is to identify the factors that contribute to these differences and explore ways to reconcile such disparities.

We employ quantum mechanics to describe the motion of particles in bound states and derive the equations that govern the expectation values of linear and angular momentum. We then apply the Schrodinger equation to solve for these values in different types of bound states, including hydrogen-like atoms and harmonic oscillators.

Using numerical calculations, we find that the expectation values of linear and angular momentum depend strongly on the quantum state of the system. Furthermore, the deviation between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements can be attributed to various factors such as the uncertainty principle and the presence of external fields.

Overall, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the reality of linear and angular momentum in bound states. These results can aid in the development of future experimental techniques for accurately measuring such expectation values and in advancing the understanding of quantum mechanics.

Text: We present our work on the resummation of large logarithms in the process of $\gamma^* \pi^0 \to \gamma$. Our motivation is to achieve a better understanding of the physics underlying this process, which has important implications for the study of hadron structure and the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs). Specifically, we aim to develop a new theoretical framework that can accurately describe the behavior of the perturbative QCD contribution to this process at high energies.

Our approach is based on the factorization theorem, which allows us to separate the short-distance perturbative contribution from the long-distance non-perturbative one. We use renormalization group techniques to resum the large logarithms arising from the evolution of the PDFs and the strong coupling constant. Our main results consist of explicit expressions for the resummed cross section and a study of their perturbative and non-perturbative uncertainties.

Overall, we find that our framework provides an improved treatment of the perturbative contribution to $\gamma^* \pi^0 \to \gamma$ at high energies, allowing for more precise measurements of the PDFs and a better understanding of hadron structure. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to deepen our understanding of QCD at high energies and to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions in hadron physics.

Text:   Using the spin wave approximation, we study the decoherence dynamics of a
central spin coupled to an antiferromagnetic environment under the application
of an external global magnetic field. The external magnetic field affects the
decoherence process through its effect on the antiferromagnetic environment. It
is shown explicitly that the decoherence factor which displays a Gaussian decay
with time depends on the strength of the external magnetic field and the
crystal anisotropy field in the antiferromagnetic environment. When the values
of the external magnetic field is increased to the critical field point at
which the spin-flop transition (a first-order quantum phase transition) happens
in the antiferromagnetic environment, the decoherence of the central spin
reaches its highest point. This result is consistent with several recent
quantum phase transition witness studies. The influences of the environmental
temperature on the decoherence behavior of the central spin are also
investigated.

Text:   The X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 was serendipitously discovered with
XMM-Newton in 2003. It lies about 0.9 degrees off the Galactic Centre and its
spectrum shows a high absorption (~8 x 10E22 cm^(-2)). Previous X-ray
observations of the source field performed in 2000 and 2001 did not detect the
source, indicative of a quiescent emission at least two orders of magnitude
fainter. The low luminosity during the outburst (~5 x 10E34 erg/s at 8 kpc)
indicates that the source is a member of the ``very faint X-ray transients''
class. On 2005 March 22nd the INTEGRAL satellite caught a possible type-I X-ray
burst from the new INTEGRAL source IGR J17464-2811, classified as fast X-ray
transient. This source was soon found to be positionally coincident, within the
uncertainties, with XMMU J174716.1-281048. Here we report data analysis of the
X-ray burst observed with the IBIS and JEM-X telescopes and confirm the type-I
burst nature. We also re-analysed XMM-Newton and Chandra archival observations
of the source field. We discuss the implications of these new findings,
particularly related to the source distance as well as the source
classification.

Text: In this work, we present a dynamical coupled-channel model of $\pi N$ scattering in the $W\leq 2$ GeV nucleon resonance region. The key idea behind our model is to account for the dynamics of the $\pi N$ scattering amplitude and the resulting resonance structures, which are critical for understanding the properties of the nucleon and its excited states. Our approach is based on a system of coupled integral equations that describe the scattering amplitude in terms of a set of channels, including both mesonic and baryonic resonances. 

We use a unitarized chiral perturbation theory to account for the mesonic interaction, while the baryonic resonances are described by a set of Breit-Wigner propagators. We then solve the integral equations using a matrix inversion technique to obtain the scattering amplitude in each channel, which is then used to calculate the total cross section and other relevant observables. 

The results obtained demonstrate that our model is able to reproduce the main features of the $\pi N$ scattering data in the resonance region, including the position and width of the resonances. We also find that the inclusion of higher resonances and their interference effects is crucial for obtaining a good description of the data. Our work provides a useful tool for studying the properties of nucleon resonances and their associated decay modes, which are important for understanding the strong interaction dynamics governing the behavior of hadrons.

Text:   We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulomb
interaction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\bar B}$ and $D {\bar
D}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We
consider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospin
I=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. We
find that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scattering
phase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\bar
K}$ production at the $\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in the
charged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phases
in both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply the
same approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass difference
between the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scattering
effects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect of
this mass difference.

Text: In this study, we present accurate QCD predictions for heavy-quark jets at the Tevatron and LHC. The motivation for this research is to provide a detailed and thorough understanding of the underlying physics principles that govern heavy quark production. Accurate QCD predictions for heavy-quark jets at the Tevatron and LHC are necessary for the proper simulation and analysis of data generated through particle collisions. We aim to develop reliable theoretical frameworks for heavy quark production, which would aid in the understanding of anomalous data points that have been observed at the Tevatron and LHC. 

The problem of properly simulating and analyzing heavy quark jets has yet to be solved adequately. Existing models are not sufficiently accurate and do not account for all the relevant physics involved in heavy-quark production. In this work, we attempt to solve this problem and rectify this shortcoming by utilizing sophisticated perturbative QCD techniques.

Key ideas and methodology in this work involve the use of precise and advanced calculations to accurately predict the production of heavy quarks. We use higher-order perturbative QCD calculations combined with Monte Carlo simulations to provide the most reliable predictions for heavy-quark jets. Our proposed methodology provides a more comprehensive and accurate way of studying heavy quark jets at the Tevatron and LHC. The results of this study will have significant implications for the analysis of future experimental data and confirm the validity of current theoretical models.

Text: In this study, we carried out an investigation of colour reconnection in WW events detected by the DELPHI detector at LEP-2. Colour reconnection is a phenomenon that occurs when quarks or gluons exchange colours during the hadronization process, leading to changes in the particle flow patterns. The motivation for this research was the need to understand the mechanisms governing hadronization to improve our knowledge of particle physics. 

To carry out this investigation, we used a sample of WW events from the DELPHI detector data, where the W bosons decayed into quarks. We studied the changes in the hadronization patterns by comparing the data to several models, including one without colour reconnection and one with a specific implementation of it. We used the Lund string model to simulate the hadronization process and compared the results to the data.

Our analysis showed that the data exhibited evidence of colour reconnection. The inclusion of colour reconnection in the simulation significantly improved the agreement between the data and the model. We also found that the models without colour reconnection could not reproduce the data, demonstrating the importance of taking this effect into account. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of hadronization, with possible implications for future studies of particle physics.

Text:   It is well known gravitational lensing, mainly via magnification bias,
modifies the observed galaxy/quasar clustering. Such discussions have largely
focused on the 2D angular correlation. Here and in a companion paper (Paper II)
we explore how magnification bias distorts the 3D correlation function and
power spectrum, as first considered by Matsubara. The interesting point is: the
distortion is anisotropic. Magnification bias preferentially enhances the
observed correlation in the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, especially on
large scales. For example at LOS separation of ~100 Mpc/h, where the intrinsic
galaxy-galaxy correlation is rather weak, the observed correlation can be
enhanced by lensing by a factor of a few, even at a modest redshift of z ~
0.35. The opportunity: this lensing anisotropy is distinctive, making it
possible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-magnification and
magnification-magnification correlations, without measuring galaxy shapes. The
anisotropy is distinguishable from the well known distortion due to peculiar
motions, as will be discussed in Paper II. The challenge: the magnification
distortion of the galaxy correlation must be accounted for in interpreting data
as precision improves. For instance, the ~100 Mpc/h baryon acoustic oscillation
scale in the correlation function is shifted by up to ~3% in the LOS
orientation, and up to ~0.6% in the monopole, depending on the galaxy bias,
redshift and number count slope. The corresponding shifts in the inferred
Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance, if ignored, could significantly
bias measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Lastly, magnification
distortion offers a plausible explanation for the well known excess
correlations seen in pencil beam surveys.

Text: In this work, we propose a Hamiltonian unification of General Relativity and the Standard Model. Our motivation stems from the need to develop a theory that can consistently unify the fundamental forces of the universe and explain phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy. Our key idea is to develop a Hamiltonian formalism that combines the principles of General Relativity and the Standard Model in a way that is mathematically consistent and physically meaningful. 

To achieve this goal, we use the framework of canonical quantization to construct the Hamiltonian operator and associated constraints of the combined theory. By imposing the constraints, we obtain a consistent quantum theory that provides a unification of gravity and the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces. 

Our results reveal that the Hamiltonian unification can provide insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy, as well as potentially resolving issues such as the hierarchy problem. Additionally, the combined theory may provide indications of new particles and interactions that have yet to be discovered experimentally. 

Overall, the proposed Hamiltonian unification presents a promising avenue towards a unified theory of physics that can account for all the fundamental forces and give us a more complete understanding of the universe.

Text: Staggered Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory (SHBχPT) is a theoretical framework developed to study the behavior of heavy baryons in the low-energy limit of Quantum Chromodynamics. We aim to explain the formalism and present some of the achievements of this potent tool.

The SHBχPT framework intends to solve the problem faced by traditional Chiral Perturbation Theory (χPT) when dealing with heavy baryons. It is not possible to use the usual techniques of chiral extrapolation for heavy baryons because they have a mass much greater than the mass scale Λ of χPT. Therefore, the SHBχPT framework combines the chiral expansion with Non-Relativistic QCD to study the low-energy regime of baryonic systems. 

The key ideas involve introducing staggered fields to ensure the correct symmetries of the theory, the use of effective field theories to study heavy particles, and the renormalization of some parameters. The methodology includes applying tools from quantum field theory and group theory, computing Feynman diagrams to the desired order, and matching our results with experiment.

Our results show that SHBχPT is a powerful framework to describe the behavior of heavy baryons. It has enabled us to compute scattering cross-sections, masses, and other quantities for different types of baryonic systems, with excellent agreement with experiments. The SHBχPT framework has proven useful in analyzing data generated by modern experiments and provides a theoretical basis for future studies.

Text: In this work, we investigate the maximum number of solutions of normalized Ricci flows on 4-manifolds. The problem we attempt to solve is to determine the maximum number of solutions of normalized Ricci flows on 4-manifolds, subject to the initial conditions of the flow being a Kähler metric. Our results show that there can be at most a finite number of solutions, and in some cases, the maximum number of solutions is exactly two.

Our key ideas and methodology involve using tools from geometric analysis, particularly the study of Ricci flows on complex manifolds, and the use of the Bochner-Kodaira-Nakano identity. We analyze the conditions under which the maximum number of solutions can be obtained, and we provide a proof of our result for the case of two solutions. Additionally, our analysis of the properties of the solutions of normalized Ricci flows on 4-manifolds allows us to draw connections to the geometry of complex algebraic surfaces, as well as to the classification of compact complex surfaces.

Overall, our work presents important contributions to the study of normalized Ricci flows on 4-manifolds, offering new insights into their behavior, and opening new avenues toward further investigation of the geometry of complex surfaces.

Text: In this work, we present the results of modelling and seismic testing of the CoRoT primary target HD 52265. The motivation for our research stems from the need to improve our understanding of the internal structure of stars and their evolution. HD 52265 is an ideal target for this study as it is a main sequence star with a mass of 1.5 solar masses and a radius of 1.6 solar radii. We constructed a grid of stellar models with a range of input parameters including different chemical compositions, which we fitted to the observed properties of HD 52265. We then calculated the frequencies of acoustic oscillations of these models and compared them to the frequencies observed by the CoRoT satellite. By matching the observed and theoretical frequencies, we were able to determine the internal properties of HD 52265 to a high degree of accuracy.

Our seismic tests allowed us to infer the rotation rate and the extent of core mixing in HD 52265, as well as to constrain the age and the extent of hydrogen and helium burning. Our results show that HD 52265 is a relatively young star with a core that rotates faster than its envelope and that the extent of core mixing is less than suggested by previous theoretical studies. We demonstrated that the combination of modelling and seismic testing is a powerful tool to constrain the fundamental properties of stars.

Text:   We report optical photometry and optical through mid-infrared spectroscopy of
the classical nova V1186 Sco. This slowly developing nova had an complex light
curve with multiple secondary peaks similar to those seen in PW Vul. The time
to decline 2 magnitudes, t$_2$, was 20 days but the erratic nature of the light
curve makes determination of intrinsic properties based on the decline time
(e.g., luminosity) problematic, and the often cited MMRD relationship of Della
Valle and Livio (1995) fails to yield a plausible distance. Spectra covering
0.35 to 35 $\mu$m were obtained in two separate epochs during the first year of
outburst. The first set of spectra, taken about 2 months after visible maximum,
are typical of a CO-type nova with narrow line emission from \ion{H}{1},
\ion{Fe}{2}, \ion{O}{1} and \ion{He}{1}. Later data, obtained between 260 and
380 days after maximum, reveal an emerging nebular spectrum. \textit{Spitzer}
spectra show weakening hydrogen recombination emission with the emergence of
[\ion{Ne}{2}] (12.81 $\mu$m) as the strongest line. Strong emission from
[\ion{Ne}{3}] (15.56 $\mu$m) is also detected. Photoionization models with low
effective temperature sources and only marginal neon enhancement (Ne $\sim$ 1.3
Ne$_{\odot}$) are consistent with these IR fine-structure neon lines indicating
that V1186 Sco did not occur on a ONeMg white dwarf. In contrast, the slow and
erratic light curve evolution, spectral development, and photoionization
analysis of the ejecta imply the outburst occurred on a low mass CO white
dwarf. We note that this is the first time strong [\ion{Ne}{2}] lines have been
detected so early in the outburst of a CO nova and suggests that the presence
of mid-infrared neon lines is not directly indicative of a ONeMg nova event.

Text: Our work aims to improve the precision of astrometry data obtained from the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Focal Reducer and Low Dispersion Spectrograph (FORS1) instrument at short time scales. Astrometry data plays a crucial role in fields such as astronomy, astrophysics, and geodesy to measure distances, orbital parameters, and movement of celestial objects. However, the limitations of instrumental and atmospheric effects can affect the accuracy of astrometry measurements. In response, we implemented a high-precision astrometry calibration method using a reference star catalog. The calibration method was applied to short time scale data sets obtained from observations of a nearby star cluster. To assess the accuracy of our method, we compared our results with astrometry data obtained from the Gaia mission. Our analysis showed an improvement of up to 10 times in the astrometry precision compared to the raw data from the VLT/FORS1 instrument. The improved precision of the astrometry data has the potential to broaden our understanding of stellar dynamics, binary star systems, and the detection of exoplanets, among others. Our work addresses a critical aspect of astrometry data analysis and demonstrates the potential of our method to improve the precision of astrometry measurements in future observations.

Text: We present a generalized analysis on the $B\to K^*\rho$ decay within and beyond the Standard Model (SM) and explore its implications on the long-standing $B \to K \pi$ puzzle. Understanding the origin of this puzzle is of utmost importance as it could potentially shed light on the structure of physics beyond the SM. The $B\to K^*\rho$ decay encompasses the $B \to K\pi$ mode as a limiting case, where the $\rho$ meson in the final state decays into a pion. By analyzing this decay, we extract valuable information about the unitarity triangle, which describes the geometric relationship between the weak phases in the CKM matrix. 

We perform a model-independent analysis of the decay amplitude, including both tree and penguin contributions, as well as new physics (NP) effects that could arise from possible beyond-SM interactions. Our results reveal that NP contributions to the decay amplitude can act constructively or destructively, leading to potentially significant deviations from the SM prediction. Moreover, by comparing the branching ratio and CP-asymmetries between $B \to K^* \rho$ and $B \to K \pi$, we can shed light on fundamental aspects of the $B \to K\pi$ puzzle. 

Our findings highlight the importance of a generalized analysis of different $B$ decays in deciphering the origin of the $B \to K\pi$ puzzle. They also point to possible experimental avenues to clarify the nature of NP in the $B\to K^*\rho$ sector and its relevance to the $B \to K\pi$ puzzle.

Text: We have developed a Spline Single-Index Prediction Model (SSIPM) that aims to solve the problem of predicting the outcome of a dependent variable based on a set of independent variables. The model comprises a combination of cubic spline functions and a single-index regression model that emphasizes nonlinearity in the predictors. We present the results of an empirical study on predicting the success of university students based on their socio-demographic and academic profiles. The data were collected from a large, public university in the United States over a four-year period. The SSIPM resulted in outperforming several traditional regression models and machine learning algorithms commonly used in educational research. The model's accuracy and robustness were evaluated by calculating various measures of fit, including the R-squared, mean squared error, and root mean squared error. Our study demonstrates the potential of SSIPM in analyzing complex data sets with non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes. It provides a flexible and interpretable framework that is useful in various fields of social science research, including economics, health, and education.
