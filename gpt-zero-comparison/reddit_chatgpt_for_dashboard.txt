Text: They were [pretty](_URL_2_) [goddamn](_URL_3_) [gaudy](_URL_6_) by our modern standards.  Here's a few more examples of them in their original "glory... 

[Augustus the Fabulous](_URL_9_), 

[Alas, Poor Yorick](_URL_5_), 

[but this helm has really good stats I swear](_URL_0_)

Even though those marble statues and busts have been, well *denuded* of their original flamboyance for thousands of years, ultraviolet analysis has revealed what time faded and chipped away:  That the Greeks and Romans had an appalling sense of color palate... that to them, the louder and gaudier, the better.

This does fly in the face of pre-modern - and even modern - asthetic... that which has judged the classic standard of beauty to be that of Purest White.  Johann Joachim Winckelmann, for instance, wrote in the 18th century: "The whiter the body is, the more beautiful it is as well [...] Color contributes to beauty, but it is not beauty. Color should have a minor part in the consideration of beauty, because it is not [color] but structure that constitutes its essence."  In other words, color *might* sometimes be a *minor* aspect to beauty, but more often simply masks its pure Platonic "True Form" which is borne out in pure marble white.  If you want a legendary cinematic example of "less color is more" ideology in practice - go watch Spielberg's [*Schindler's List*](_URL_10_).  Purity is the absence of distractions like color, much like true beauty is that of makeup and artifice washed away... clean, pure, holy.  Your can see it everywhere you might wish in later adoption of the assumed Greco-Roman style: from [Michelangelo](_URL_1_), to [Napoleon](_URL_4_), to [Honest Abe](_URL_8_)... pure white is just how we do.

Yet, UV analysis indicates, it was quite the opposite.  The Greeks and Romans were all about making their divine figures and august leaders as circus-clown vibrant as they possibly could.  It is really intriguing to think how our own conceptions of beauty and form might have been influenced and fundamentally changed from what they are... had the conception of "gaudy=great" survived the classical period... a timeline where if we thought of "noble history" we imagined a baby-pink Julius Caesar clothed in canary-yellow toga.

Text: Australia is renowned for its plethora of venomous animals, including snakes, spiders, jellyfish, and marine creatures such as box jellyfish, cone snails, and stonefish. This high concentration of venomous animals is due to multiple factors linked to Australia's geographic position, climate, and ecological history.

Australia's isolation from other landmasses is often cited as a major factor contributing to the evolution of highly venomous species. This isolation has fostered a unique and diverse ecosystem that has granted venomous creatures the opportunity to occupy ecological niches that would otherwise be filled by non-venomous species or predators. Australia's arid interior also creates an ideal habitat for venomous creatures, as many venomous species are better adapted to survive in dry environments than their non-venomous counterparts.

Moreover, Australia's unique climate has also contributed to the evolution of venomous animals. The continent's extreme weather variations, including droughts, floods, and bushfires, have driven evolution by selecting for organisms that can survive and thrive in such hostile environments. Venomous animals have also evolved specialized hunting and defense mechanisms due to Australia's long-standing arid conditions.

Finally, Australia has a rich ecological history. The continent has been largely separated from other landmasses for millions of years, allowing for extensive speciation and the development of unique ecological systems. As a result, Australia has developed a unique range of venomous species that reflects its ecological history.

Overall, the high concentration of venomous animals in Australia is due to a combination of factors, including the continent's isolation, arid climate, and unique ecological history. Although this creates challenges for human safety, understanding the drivers of evolution that have led to this concentration of venomous species can provide insight into the mechanisms of evolution and the importance of maintaining ecological diversity.

Text: The Great Pyramid of Giza is an architectural marvel that has been a source of fascination and mystery for centuries. Built around 2560 BCE, it is one of the oldest and largest buildings in the world. The question arises, did the Romans know about its age when they ruled Egypt?

It is uncertain whether the Romans knew the age of the pyramid. The Roman Empire was at the peak of its power between 27 BCE and 14 CE, almost 2600 years from the time the pyramid was constructed. At this time, the pyramid was already an ancient structure, and it is possible that the Romans were aware of its massive size and wonder. Historians believe that Romans knew about the Egyptian pyramids, as they were important tourist sites for wealthy Romans.

However, there are no direct sources of evidence indicating that Romans knew the age of the Great Pyramid of Giza. The pyramid was built centuries before the rise of the Roman Empire, and there may not have been any records or knowledge about the structure's exact age. The ancient Egyptians believed that the Great Pyramid was the tomb of the pharaoh Khufu, but they did not leave any records specifying its construction date. Although ancient Greek historians, such as Herodotus, wrote about the pyramids and their history, there is no mention of the structures' age.

Therefore, it is unclear whether the Romans knew about the pyramid's age. While they certainly would have been aware of the pyramids as an awe-inspiring part of the Egyptian landscape, it is unlikely that they had specific knowledge of the structure's history or age. Until more evidence surfaces, it remains an intriguing mystery.

Text: Yes, when you shine a flashlight at Mars, a small amount of the light actually reaches it. However, the amount of light that reaches Mars is very minuscule, and it cannot be seen by the human eye. 

The reason for this is that Mars is located at a distance of approximately 140 million miles from Earth on average. Due to this enormous distance, light from any source, including a flashlight, undergoes a phenomenon called attenuation. Attenuation is a process whereby the intensity of light decreases as it travels through space.

The intensity of light decreases due to two main factors â€“ absorption and scattering. Absorption occurs when light is absorbed by dust, gas molecules, and other materials in space. Scattering, on the other hand, happens when light is refracted by particles in the atmosphere.

Therefore, although some of the light from the flashlight reaches Mars, the intensity of this light is incredibly low. It is estimated that only a tiny fraction of the original light beam can be detected on Mars.

In conclusion, while it is technically possible for some of the light from a flashlight to reach Mars, the reality is that the distance between the two planets is so great that the amount of light that actually makes it to Mars is negligible.

Text: Hi guys. Software Engineer here. This might be a little bit more for 13 year olds than for 5 year olds but please bear with me.  
About 10 years ago I discovered hacking in Counter-Strike. I tried out a couple of different cheats and even managed to make previously detected cheats undetectable by the VAC system.  

Common with almost all first person shooters is that hacking in them is a lot easier than with strategy games. For example, it is possible to "hack" games like Red Alert 2 by removing the fog of war or by increasing your money, but that'll usually only work if you are the host (and if you're not, you'll be getting reduced fog of war at best which is indeed some advantage but a really good player will always win against a lousy player with fog of war hacks)...

Back to the main point, hacking in first person shooters is incredibly easy. It is trivial with today's technology to hook into the game executable, read the memory (and even modify it) and leverage that information to simulate mouse movements. What you really want to do (as a cheater) in a first person shooter is either see through walls or aim automatically. Aiming automatically is really easy when you have access to the memory, because you'll know the exact pixel coordinates of the enemy that your system is about to render and you'll know that you're aiming smack in the center of the screen (so (400, 300) if you're playing on 800x600 resolution), the vector that your mouse needs to travel is therefore **incredibly** easy to calculate, and moving the mouse is also really easy since these games run on Windows which uses the Windows API.  
Now the really interesting thing is wallhacking, your game client doesn't get the information about enemies until it becomes likely that you will have to render them soon. If you've ever tried to use a wallhacking cheat, you may have noticed that your wallhack doesn't show entities (players, grenades, barrels, etc) that are being clipped by the server (clipped in this case means not being rendered due to being obviously out of view). What some wallhacks do is try to guess where players are by trying to sound-spot them, some of you old-schoolers may recognize early stages of this kind of hacking as `step step step` as seen from across the map. There are also other details that can be considered but for the sake of explaining to a Layman I think I'll leave it at that.

So there you have it, and here's a short TL;DR:  
1. It's easier to hack in first person shooters than most other games **since the hacking happens on the client side**.  
2. Games like Dota and LoL (RA2 was used in my example) are difficult to affect on the client side to produce better results than a human player would.  
3. Hacking games is pretty much a solved problem, and it's very boring. If you're going to hack a game, you should probably stop playing that game and find something more exciting.  

Great summary [here](_URL_0_).

Text: Arms dealing in the modern sense occurs when there is a technological gap between what the purchasers can buy locally and what is available from "foreign" sources who have desirable technologies that the locals cannot match. This creates a market opportunity for the foreign sellers, as well as political incentives for foreign statesmen to block those sales (in order to maintain a military advantage over the locals) and local statesmen to circumvent those controls (thus creating the conditions for a black market and criminal trading).

I am aware of one such case historically, and that is the arrival of matchlock firearms in Japan in the mid-16th Century. These were carried by Portuguese traders, who were quite happy to demonstrate their destructive power to the local Japanese, who in turn were smart enough to recognize that this was a game-changing military technology, and immediately began scheming to buy as much as they could.

The Lord of Tanegashima paid an exorbitant sum for the first guns to pass into Japanese hands, in the 1540s, and he immediately turned them over to his own weaponsmiths to figure out how to make more. However, the key technology was not the barrel or the firing mechanism, as you might think, but the threading of the breech. Japanese metal workers had no experience with that. So... back to the Portuguese for more arms dealing. This time the purchase was lessons in the fine points of gunsmithy from a Portuguese smith, and the price, according to legend, included the Lord's own daughter, which he willingly paid.

With that knowledge, the Lord of Tanegashima was able to produce something like 600 guns of his own, and turn around and start selling them in turn to others in Japan. With that, the Portuguese monopoly on matchlock gun technology waned, and within a generation Japan was fielding armies of gunners and winning battles with them. By the time flintlock weapons were developed in Europe in the early 17th Century, the Portuguese were restricted to trading through Nagasaki only. Flintlock weapons never took strong root in Japan, so for whatever reason, the black market incentives did not encourage much in the way of further arms dealing, despite the fact that flintlocks were a significant advance over matchlocks.

Text: Russian roulette is a game of chance that has gained infamy because of its life-threatening nature. It is believed to have originated in Imperial Russia, where it was played by officers and aristocrats, possibly as a form of self-harm and suicide. However, the actual origin of Russian roulette is obscure, and the earliest known reference dates back to the late 19th century. 

Russian roulette is played by chambering one bullet in a revolver and spinning the cylinder. The players take turns pointing the gun at their own head and pulling the trigger. The game continues until one player shoots themselves or the chamber with the bullet is no longer in play. 

There are anecdotal accounts of people playing Russian roulette, but most of these are from the 20th century. Some reports suggest that the game was played during the Vietnam War, either as a means of relieving boredom or as a form of hazing. There are also reports of Russian soldiers playing the game during the Chechen Wars in the 1990s. However, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of these claims, and they may be exaggerated or false. 

As for survivors, there are some reports of individuals who have played Russian roulette and survived. For example, in 2014, a man from Kansas City, Missouri, survived after playing the game with friends. However, these cases are few and far between, and it is important to note that playing Russian roulette is incredibly dangerous and can result in serious injury or death. 

In conclusion, the origin of Russian roulette is unclear, but it is believed to have been played in Imperial Russia by officers and aristocrats. There are reports of the game being played in the 20th century, but it is difficult to verify the authenticity of these claims. There are also some accounts of people surviving playing the game, but these are rare and should not be taken as an endorsement of this dangerous activity. Playing Russian roulette is a reckless and potentially deadly act, and should never be attempted.

Text: Don Quixote hit many goals that modern novels try to hit, including social commentary and literary critique through the use of characters both pious and secular. Through humor and irony, it made the reader question their beliefs rather than simply entertain or reiterate popular ideas or history.

Cervantes published the book in 1605, over a century after the Reconquista that made Spain Christian once more. However, this was four years prior to the Moriscos being expelled from Spain in 1609. (Morisco being the term applied to the descnedants of Muslims that had converted to Christianity.) Cervantes was writing in a turbulent time, and he had experienced many slices of life. He left Spain for Renaissance Italy, fought in the navy of the Catholics in the Ottoman-Hapsburg war, had been enslaved in Algiers for a few years, and also imprisoned by Spain when found abusing his role as a tax collector. 

These various experiences at this time lead to much of the nuance that makes Don Quixote one of the first modern novels. The actions of Don Quixote undermine simple chivalroc romances or morality tales by showing how following one ethical code without question can lead to delusion and immoral actions. This is not to mean every priest is painted poorly, even though the Holy Brotherhood isn't put in the best light at all times. And not all villains are able to be saved, as the slaves set free by Quixote end up causing more trouble. 

This novel in turn uses the faults in the current  culture's stars (so to speak, stars referring to knights like Amadis of Gaul and other popular in 17th century Spain) in order to show the faults in the current culture itself. This is where Cervantes's use of realism, allusion, and metafiction come into play. Some characters take the cultural stories seriously, some are hobbyists, some make a living off them, some ignore them. Cervantes depicts a relatively balanced vision of pastoral life in his time while using his main characters to humourously poke holes. It is through his allusion and metafiction, especially in part 2, where this humor challenges the reader's belief in ways that works prior to this did not. 

Many are unable to tell which side Cervantes is on, having created such an insanely idealistic character in a realistic backdrop. It did not tell a history, teach a moral, or promote a side, but it expressed the differences and between truth and fiction, between reality and the ideal. He provided no clear answer, but instead used his work to attempt to instill a type of critical thinking in his readers.

Concessions:

Now, to refer to the title of the first great modern novel, there are some other concessions besides the content and immediate context of the book. For instance, Cervantes wrote his prose at the same time Shakespeare developed his plays. In fact, Hamlet is often seen as an antithesis to Don Quixote. The Spanish Golden Age and Elizabethan Era show the Renaissance of western Europe and a questioning of the religious ways that dominated culture centuries prior. So at this time, humanist and secular ideas permeated as well as united Western European thought, allowkng for these writers to have a lasting impact.

This title 'first great modern novel' is also Eurocentric to a degree, but who would not want to have that cultural trophy? First, it is a prose novel, not an epic poem or play. However, other novels had been written. For instance, the Tale of Genji also is a claimant to the title, being a wondeful depiction of Heian court life and classic Japanese culture, written in the 11th century. However, it was not translated to modern Japanese until the 1900s. Meanwhile, Don Quixote was a more thematically tight, plot driven, and preserved work that influenced French revolutionaries, Schopenhauer, and other great minds (albeit, still Western, so Eurocentrism is still present to a degree).

Text: Otto Von Bismarck, the Chancellor of Prussia from 1862 and of Germany from 1871, was undoubtedly one of the most influential political figures of the 19th century. His diplomatic skills and mastery of Realpolitik maneuvers helped him to overcome internal and external challenges and transform fragmented Germany into a powerful and centralized nation. However, his intentions and motives for creating the German Empire continue to be the subject of historical debate.

One of the most persistent explanations for Bismarck's foreign policy is that he deliberately provoked or escalated conflicts in Europe to weaken his enemies and rally German states under the Prussian crown. This theory is partly supported by Bismarck's own writings, such as his Memoirs, where he boasted about his "blood and iron" tactics and his vision of a "Greater Germany" dominated by Prussia. Additionally, Bismarck's actions during the Schleswig-Holstein crisis (1863-64), the Austro-Prussian War (1866), and the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) appear to confirm his willingness to use force and manipulation to achieve his goals.

However, there are also several counterarguments to this interpretation. Firstly, Bismarck's role in some of these conflicts was not always straightforward, and he had to adapt to changing circumstances and alliances. For instance, in the Austro-Prussian War, he initially attempted to persuade Austria to join a loose federation with Prussia, but when that failed, he used military force to humiliate Austria and dissolve their influence over Germany. Similarly, in the Franco-Prussian War, Bismarck relied on a series of incidents and miscalculations by Napoleon III, rather than a preconceived plan, to justify a preemptive attack on France.

Secondly, Bismarck's objectives for the German Empire were not solely focused on national unification or expansion. He also saw the need for social and economic reforms, such as introducing social insurance, regulating labor relations, and modernizing agriculture and industry. These policies, collectively referred to as the "New Course," were intended to address the needs and demands of the growing working classes and prevent socialist and revolutionary uprisings.

In conclusion, while it is plausible that Bismarck used conflicts in Europe as a means to achieve German unification and Prussian dominance, it is equally valid to view his actions as reactive, contingent, and multifaceted. Bismarck was a pragmatic opportunist who pursued a variety of goals and strategies, depending on the situation and the actors involved. Therefore, any attempt to reduce Bismarck's legacy to a simplistic narrative of war-mongering or nation-building ignores the complexity and nuances of his leadership and the historical context in which he operated.

Text: Alexander the Great's decision to adopt many Persian customs and advisors was likely a strategic move on his part. He wanted to establish himself as a legitimate ruler over the vast Persian Empire that he had conquered and hoped to rule. By adopting Persian ways, he could demonstrate to the Persian people that he respected their culture and traditions and was not just an invading conqueror.

Additionally, Alexander recognized the strengths of Persian culture and wanted to incorporate them into his own rule. The Persians were skilled administrators and architects, and Alexander likely recognized the benefits of incorporating their expertise into his own reign. Furthermore, Alexander had a deep admiration for the Persian leader Cyrus the Great, who had established one of the largest empires in history and was highly respected for his just and fair rule.

It's worth noting that Alexander's admiration for Persian culture did not diminish his admiration for Greek culture. In fact, he likely saw himself as a bridge between the two cultures and sought to create a new Hellenistic-Persian fusion that would benefit both peoples. Alexander recognized the benefits of a cosmopolitan empire, where people of different cultures and backgrounds could coexist in harmony and share their knowledge and expertise.

In conclusion, Alexander's decision to adopt aspects of Persian culture was a strategic move intended to legitimize his rule and incorporate the strengths of Persian culture into his own reign. He also recognized the benefits of a cosmopolitan empire and sought to create a new cultural fusion between Greeks and Persians that would benefit both peoples.

Text: The truth is that in the majority of cases we don't know! It is group of muscle fibers independently contracting, but why this happens is usually unknown. Some people will have electrolyte disturbances (hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), some have metabolic problems (hypothyroidism, low B12), some will be hypovolemic (dehydrated or overuse of diuretics), some have structural problems (flat feet!) but again the majority of people with recurrent leg cramps DONT have any identifiable cause of their cramping.

Looking a little deeper, it seems as though before the cramping there is a period of increased motor neuron hyperactivity, this depletes muscular ATP, which in turn causes the cytosol to become overloaded with calcium. When a muscle cell has too much calcium the actin myosin bridges can't unlock (I think - it has been a LONG time since I learned about muscular physiology) and this causes the cramp!

Text: If a feather was in a decaying orbit around the Earth, it would eventually re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. Whether or not it burns up during re-entry depends on a few different factors.

Firstly, the feather's mass and size would play a significant role in determining what happens during re-entry. A feather is very light and small compared to other objects that may enter the atmosphere, such as satellites or spacecraft. This means that the feather would experience less stress and heat during re-entry, and therefore is less likely to burn up.

Secondly, the feather's velocity would also be an important factor to consider. If it was traveling at a relatively low speed, it would encounter less resistance from the atmosphere and would be less likely to burn up. However, if it was traveling at a high speed, it would experience more friction and heat, making it more likely to burn up or be destroyed.

Lastly, the angle at which the feather enters the atmosphere would also affect its fate. If it enters at a steep angle, it will experience more resistance and heat, making it more likely to burn up. If it enters at a shallow angle, it will have a longer path through the atmosphere, allowing it to lose more velocity and potentially avoiding burning up.

In conclusion, whether or not a feather burns up during re-entry depends on its size, mass, velocity, and angle of entry. It is possible for a feather to survive re-entry without burning up, but it is also possible for it to be destroyed.

Text: So you want to run a saloon? That sounds really cool! In the mid 1800s, things were different than they are now. You couldn't just go to the store and buy everything you needed. You had to get creative!

So first off, you're gonna need some drinks! Lots of cowboys and travelers coming through town will be thirsty. You'll want to stock up on things like beer and whiskey. Maybe even some wine if you're fancy. But be careful, you don't want to give too much to anyone. It's important to keep everyone safe.

Next, you'll want some snacks. Maybe some jerky or some peanuts. You could even try making your own pickles or bread. People will get hungry after riding or driving for a while.

It's important to have a good atmosphere at your saloon too. Maybe some poker tables or a piano for people to sing along to. You could even hang up some wanted posters or rustic decorations.

And last but not least, you'll need to find some good people to work with you. Maybe some friendly bartenders or some tough bouncers. Just make sure they're trustworthy and won't cheat you out of your profits.

Overall, running a saloon takes hard work but it can be really fun too. Just remember to keep everything safe and respectful for everyone. Good luck!

Text: Well, I'm not really sure what "sexuality" means, but I know that women have babies and stuff. In the olden times, people didn't really understand how that all worked, so they were scared of it. They thought women were kind of weird and tried to control them. 

Then, I guess some scientists got interested in studying women's bodies and all the things that happen to them. They started a special field of medicine called Gynecology. They wanted to learn about things like how babies grow in a mommy's tummy and how to help women who had problems with their bodies. 

But even though the doctors were trying to help women, sometimes they didn't really understand them. They might have made the women feel weird or embarrassed. And sometimes they did things to women's bodies without really asking or explaining what was happening. 

So I guess even though Gynecology was meant to help women, it still contributed to the misunderstandings and fears about women's bodies. But hopefully, as people learn more and become more respectful of others, we can be more understanding and helpful to women in the future.

Text: Yes, the benefits of yoga are scientifically proven. Numerous studies have shown that practicing yoga regularly can lead to numerous physical and mental health benefits. Here are some examples:

-Improved flexibility and strength: Practicing yoga regularly can help improve flexibility, strength, and balance. This can be especially beneficial for older adults, athletes, and people with physical disabilities.

-Stress reduction: Yoga has been shown to help reduce stress and anxiety. This is likely due to its focus on mindfulness, meditation, and breathing techniques.

-Pain relief: Yoga has been found to be helpful in reducing chronic pain, such as back pain or arthritis. This may be due to the combination of stretches, strengthening exercises, and relaxation techniques.

-Improved heart health: Yoga has been shown to be beneficial for heart health, including reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

As for how the inventors of yoga made up the asanas and knew their benefits, it's likely that they discovered them through trial and error, as well as observing the effects of different poses on the body and mind. The origins of yoga are ancient and somewhat mysterious, but many scholars believe that it developed in India around 5,000 years ago as a way to promote physical and spiritual well-being. Over time, different styles of yoga emerged, each with its own set of poses and philosophies. Today, there are many different styles of yoga, ranging from gentle and meditative to more vigorous and athletic.

Text: I am assuming you are thinking about a scenario similar to commercial flights so let's start there. In a commercial flight you have a pressurized volume flying high in the atmosphere (where pressure is low). There you have a pressure differential and if the doors were to open then yes, chaos would happen (sudden decompression)

However, skydiving airplanes are not pressurized. Therefore there is no sudden decompression when you open the door. The reasons why you commercial flights have a pressurized environment is first: 
-After ~~18k~~14k feet you need supplementary oxygen and the air at that altitude doesn't have enough
-Second, a pressurized cabin offers a comfortable environment

Skydiving airplanes don't need it because they don't go (usually) above ~~18k~~ 14k feet so you don't need supplementary Oxygen and really, you are going to Skydiving so some uncomfortable situations are expected!
When you have ~~18k+~~ 14k ft skydives then you are supplied with Oxygen until the time to jump is upon you.

Source: I skydive 

Edit: As some people have pointed out, the altitude where you require Oxygen is 14k. In Skydiving let's say i am going to jump from 18k and the rest of the jumpers only at 13k. When we reach 13k, they open the door and jump out. I then close the door, grab my Oxygen and wait until 18k so I have Oxygen from 13k-18k

Text: Well, I'm not exactly sure, but I think it might be possible to recreate a smell from a basic list of smells. You know how you can mix different colors together to make new colors? Well, maybe you can mix different smells together to make new smells too!

But I don't think there's an RGB equivalent for smells. RGB is a way to talk about colors and how much red, green, and blue they have. But smells are different than colors because they don't have a specific set of ingredients that you can measure like with RGB. Smells are made up of lots of little particles that float in the air, and when we breathe them in, we can smell them. 

So, I guess if you wanted to recreate a smell, you would need to know what kinds of particles are in it, and then you could try to find other smells with similar particles and mix them together. But it might not be exact because each smell is unique, just like each color is unique. 

But don't worry too much about it! Smells are pretty cool and interesting, and there's still a lot we don't know about them. Maybe one day scientists will figure out a way to recreate smells perfectly, just like they can with colors!

Text: Well, first of all, it's not exactly easy to make any movement in a video game look natural, but there are some specific challenges when it comes to walking up or down stairs. One of the main issues is figuring out how to make the movement of the character's legs look natural and smooth, as they have to adjust their stride to work with the height and depth of each individual step. This can be tricky, especially when trying to account for different heights and widths of stairs across different environments in the game.

Another challenge is making sure that the character's body moves realistically as they climb or descend the stairs. This includes things like the swinging of their arms, the movement of their torso, and even the way their head bobs slightly with each step. Depending on the game engine being used, it can be difficult to get all of these elements working together in a way that looks fluid and natural.

Finally, there are some technical limitations that can make it tough to create realistic stair-walking animations. For example, if a game is designed for multiple platforms with different hardware capabilities, it may be necessary to create different animations for stairs depending on the device being used. Additionally, some games may be limited by the processing power of the system they're running on, which can make it harder to create complex animations that account for all the nuances of stair-walking.

All of these factors combine to make creating realistic stair-walking animations in video games a challenging task. However, with time, practice, and the right tools, game developers are continually improving their abilities to create more lifelike gaming experiences for players.

Text: Incredible as it may seem, the US government, during the Rwandan Genocide, was very much aware of the unfolding catastrophe and chose not to intervene. The murky history of US intervention in foreign conflicts makes it a complicated subject, but in this case, there was very little domestic pressure to address the situation in Rwanda. The general attitude at the time was that there was little to no national interest in the region, and the general public did not see the genocide as a significant threat to national security.

The Rwandan genocide, which took place between April and July of 1994, left an estimated 800,000 people dead. The conflict began after the assassination of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana. Despite his own people's warnings, President Clinton's administration chose not to intervene.

The US government's decision not to intervene has since faced severe criticism and has been marked as one of the greatest foreign policy failures. However, at that time, there was almost no public debate about whether or not the US should intervene.

The events in Rwanda were often overlooked as a result of several other geopolitical issues taking place in the world at the time. It was a period of significant global conflict, from the ongoing conflict in the Balkans, negotiations with North Korea, and the first war in Iraq. Also, the US had just recently retreated from Somalia after 18 US servicemen were killed. This event was also a significant factor in the Clinton administration's view of intervention in Africa. With a bruised national ego from Somalia, the administration felt that the American public would not accept another engagement in Africa with the possibility of US causalities.

In conclusion, the administration chose not to intervene in Rwanda, and there was essentially no domestic pressure to intervene. The decision not to act during the Rwandan Genocide was deemed a significant failure of US foreign policy and remains a painful lesson in the cost of inaction.

Text: Yes, there were former slaves who lived long enough to witness and even meet Martin Luther King Jr. during the Civil Rights Movement. Though the exact number of former slaves who were alive during this time is not known, it is estimated that around 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. This means that many former slaves were likely in their 90s or even older during MLK Jr.'s activism.

One such example is Daisy Lee Bates, who was an influential civil rights activist and mentor to the Little Rock Nine. She was born in 1914 in Huttig, Arkansas, and was raised by adoptive parents after her mother's death. Though she was not technically a slave, as she was born 51 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, she grew up in a heavily segregated society and experienced racism firsthand. She later founded the Arkansas State Press newspaper and worked alongside MLK Jr. to integrate Little Rock Central High School.

Another example is Fannie Lou Hamer, who was born in Mississippi in 1917. She was the youngest of 20 children and was forced to drop out of school in the third grade to work on a plantation. She became involved in the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and worked tirelessly to register African Americans to vote. She met MLK Jr. in 1962 and spoke at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, where she famously said, "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired."

These are just two examples of the many former slaves who lived to see and contribute to the Civil Rights Movement. While we may never know exactly how many former slaves were alive during this time, their stories serve as a reminder of the enduring legacy of slavery and the ongoing fight for racial equality in America.
