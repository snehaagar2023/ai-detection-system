# CS162 Final Project Dev Set

The format is .jsonl files containing human text under “human_text” and AI text under “machine_text.” The original data comes from the M4 dataset (Wang et al., 2024), so this dataset may not be used for training. 

We may use the same or different models for the final evaluation, and the test data may come from different sources. We will not disclose details about the models used to generate the AI test data to avoid solutions that overfit to these models.
