      "The tempting way to answer this question is to make some comparisons between Mongolia and Xinjiang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of those territories are similar in that they were never \"Chinese\", they are both steppe territories which no Chinese state had ever turned into provinces in pre-modern times, they were unsuitable for the sort of agriculture practiced in China proper, and they both had very small number of ethnic Chinese by the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "So logically both of those regions -should- have being independent following the fall of the Qing dynasty when the central government  ruled by decedents of nomadic conquerors in China was replaced by a nationalist, Republican government ruled by ethnic Han Chinese. The role of those regions as a part of the multi-ethnic Qing empire was gone and what sort of role was to be played in a nation state which excluded them was unknown. Yet only Mongolia declared independence in the aftermath of the 1911 revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "For several reasons Xinjiang did not go independent from China upon the fall of the dynasty or even when the Nationalist central government was weak and had almost no control over the region during the 1920s-1930s. Furthermore, just as in Mongolia, there were alternatives to Chinese rule: The Japanese and the Soviets both had interest in chipping the region away from China. The Soviets went as far as invading in the 1930s.\n",
      "\n",
      "But yet Xinjiang was never de jure independent from China, this had to do with several factors as identified by Kenneth Pomeranz:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1)** Placate/allying with the local elite, there is a strong line of continuity in Chinese policy from the Qing to the Republican to the Maoist era (sometimes the exact same people were in charge across different regimes) in which Chinese governors of the region mostly (but not always!) restricted Chinese migration as to not provoke the locals (along with other policies of course). A hands-off approach by whichever governor was put in charge of the region was expected. As a result the local elite -preferred- to deal with the Chinese government rather than full on independence. And at least enough of them preferred the Chinese government over the Soviets.\n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast in Mongolia the Qing government had started to sinonize the region in the early 20th century in an effort to keep control over the region, by doing so they ironically provoked the Mongolian elite into declaring independence and requesting Russian aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2)** The Chinese intellectual elite were able to convince themselves that Xinjiang was really a part of China: this is especially vital because in the 19th century the region was essentially a buffer state for the Qing Empire and there were serious talks about withdrawing from the region for a while. By the 20th century there seem to be a conviction to make an effort to keep the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the same could be said with regards to Mongolia at least superficially, but the Chinese Communist government chose to give up all claims to the region. The KMT in Taipei however theoretically still claims Mongolia as part of China to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3)** China was able to convince -everybody else- that Xinjiang is a part of China as oppose to a colonial possession like British India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, this was not true of Mongolia, but it could be said that it's because China simply lost the territory too soon after the 1911 revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I think of the three reasons, they key reason really had to do with how the Qing government dealt with the local elite in the early 20th century and threatening to turn Mongolia into an ethnic Han majority province (as they already did with Manchuria) and pushed them into the anti-Chinese camp. Whereas in Xinjiang this process was mostly resisted until the 1980s. Yes, Soviet support was crucial for Mongolian independence, but yet the same sort of armed support was in place for Xinjiang (and was for a period of time during late 30s-40s when Xinjiang was a de facto Soviet satellite). But the local elite never declared independence except for one small separatist group and therefore allowed for China to play the waiting game in the 1930s-40s until they were strong enough to reclaim the region. At the same time, I can't think of too many pro-Chinese Mongolian elites after 1911. The opinions of said elites was the crucial factor in the contest over the fate are periphery regions where the ability of central governments to project power was relatively weak.\n",

      "We investigate depletion effects in smectic phases of hard rod--hard sphere mixtures. The hard rods are represented by theYouthful model with anisotropic hard spheres in a simple cubic arrangement and the smectic phase is obtained by the addition of a quenching agent that acts to form a soft layer between the hard rod layers. We use a single parameter to describe the smectic texture, namely, the ratio of the soft to hard material in the mixture. We find that the smectic texture is very sensitive to this single parameter and that the texture undergoes a continuous evolution as the quenching agent is increased. The texture evolution has several interesting features. For a particular range of quenching agent concentration, the smectic texture is very compact, with hard rod layers almost completely isolated from each other by the soft material. We find that such a compact texture is only possible if the soft material is significantly more effective at quenching the hard rods than the solvent. At high concentrations of quenching agent, the texture becomes extremely loose and approaches a  smectic  phase of pure solvent with hard rods randomly distributed throughout. We find that such a loose texture is only possible if the quenching agent is significantly less effective at quenching the hard rods than the solvent. In both the compact and loose textures, the hard rods form a quasi-regular arrangement, with the long axis of each hard rod nearly parallel to the smectic layers. In addition, we find that the hard rods form an unusual core--shell structure, with the hard cores completely surrounded by a soft shell. The structure is stable with respect to changes in the solvent content. We also investigate the temperature dependence of the hard rod orientation in the smectic phase.\n",

      "If we take the 1870s as the time period for the setting of *The Hateful Eight*, we can also pinpoint certain contexts occurring in New Zealand at the time which might give us clues as to why this character was present in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason, is trade. Ships regularly plied their way between the west coast of North America and New Zealand, starting several decades before the 1870s. One of the wealthiest businessmen in New Zealand, Thomas Russell, made a fortune during the goldrush by selling shiploads of onions to San Francisco, seeing that the large number of new arrivals to the city would require food. His father and brothers had travelled to California themselves, hoping to make their fortunes on the goldfields. There is plenty of evidence to suggest regular travel between the two regions was possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major cause of migration during the 1800s was a desire to make one's fortune. New Zealand had been populated by British settlers who were drawn there through advertising campaigns in Britain. These were largely false or embellished in order to encourage more migration. They had to be very enticing, as New Zealand was so far away when compared to the other English speaking destinations available: Australia, Canada, America. But not everyone who made it to New Zealand was successful, and to that end, it's possible that a number of people, upon realising that New Zealand didn't offer the opportunities they hoped for, instead chose to move on to the other colonies. Australia and California would be major destinations here if a return to the UK wasn't an option. This is especially likely because at this period, New Zealand was still developing from provinces into a country, whereas America was far more formed as a state. *(Edited note: I forgot to mention this when I first wrote it, but during the 1870s/80s/90s, Auckland, the biggest city, went through several economic fluctuations including a bust that lasted from the late 70s to the early 90s. This could have been a problem for a lot of people's livelihoods).*\n",
      "\n",
      "The final reason is related to opportunities, but of a different sort. 1872 marked the end of the New Zealand Wars, with the peace being made between Te Kooti and the government. During the wars, there were examples of mercenaries arriving to fight in New Zealand (Von Tempsky, a Prussian soldier who had also served in Central America being the most famous of these), and the frontier battles were coming to an end in New Zealand. The West in America was probably seen as a land of opportunity, and as a fellow English speaking colony, New Zealand would have been a prime market for advertising from migration companies (I don't have any proof of this, it's just an idea). Further to that, the image of the West as a wild frontier would be a drawcard for the soldiers who were now being released from service to peaceful lives. Many of them weren't actually New Zealanders, but men who had come from abroad in response to government advertising. The government offered them bad quality land, so many did their service, sold the land, and left again. The likelihood of mercenary soldiers who had been drawn from Australia to New Zealand then deciding to move on to entirely new pastures where there particular skills might be useful makes America a drawcard.\n",

      "\n",
      "Microsoft released Windows version 3.1 in 1991, which came with a slew of features which were game-changing, like OLE, the Registry, common dialogs, and TrueType fonts. On OS 7, Apple released several TrueType fonts, among which were included Times Roman, Helvetica, and Courier. Windows included three fonts by default to match these, in terms of style, functionality, and metrics: Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New.\n",

It's useful to separate between the \"American Revolution\" and the \"War for Independence.\" The war was a global event if only because the British Empire was so far-reaching: some historians believe that the loss of the American colonies helped lead Britain to expand its empire outside of the Atlantic. However, as a \"news\" event, it would have been significant as well. An average citizen's awareness of the War for Independence in America was almost certainly proportional to his or her access to global networks of communication and print. Obviously, these connections can't be taken for granted in the 18th century. \n",

      "A big part of it is your mental wiring. When you are newborn and up until 2 or 3 years, your brain is still maturing to the point where it can actually collect long-term memories. Then you're all about slamming the world around you into your long-term memory so you can grow enough to interact with it as quickly as possible. Most 20+ year old people don't recall anything that happened to them in their toddler years (there are exceptions) because it was all about building automatic-function foundations - here are my fingers and I can wiggle them like this, when I do that it hurts, I go here when I'm hungry, that sort of stuff.\n",

      "In the early and post-Restoration 17th century, unwieldly biblical and Bible-ish phrases as names bore the brunt of jokes. Most of this was driven by anti-puritan/nonconformist sentiment or the good politics of being anti-puritan in public, since \"Job-rakt-by-the-ashes\" and similar names were strongly associated with puritans. But they weren't exclusive to it, as *Sir* Faithful Fortescue (and his son Faithful and his nephew Faithful...) shows. The point is, the focal point of ostracizing and ridiculing religious noncomformity provided a cultural shorthand for mockable names.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even some of those sympathetic to puritans--as David Como argues, we need to talk about a spectrum rather than a distinct sect even before the English Civil War--seem to have viewed the names as a shade of ridiculousness, as minister Thomas Adams did in 1629:\n",

      " >  it is a petulant absurdity to give [children] ridiculous names, the very rehearsing whereof causeth laughter. There be certain affectate names which mistaken zeal chooseth for honour, but the event discovers a proud singularity....as if they would tie the goodness of the \n",

      "In contrast, Jo(h)n Jo(h)nson is a name that pops up frequently in the Calendar of State Papers volumes released by the British PRO for the 17th century. Just as a sample, the 1637 volume mentions two distinct John Johnsons; the 1629 one also mentions two. They seem to come from a variety of social levels. One of our 1637 mentions is a new arrival to London. A 1629 representative is a university fellow.\n",

      "Although John Johnson (\"spelled variously\", says the index) appears to have been the most common double, I did find some Richard Richardsons as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this is to say: mere incidence of the name--even though given the limited sample, the number of John Johnson is probably significant--isn't enough to say people *didn't* do a double-take at the pseudonym. After all, the pattern of puritan names being mocked had roots in people's actual, baptismal-record names, too.\n",

      "However, if Fawkes had intended to be ridiculous, he had a whole barn of name options to choose from that would have been instantly and acceptably recognized as such in popular culture. Instead, he picked a name with a reasonable amount of currency in London at different levels of society.\n",

      "* If you haven't yet, hie thee to Charles Bardsley's *[Curiosities of Puritan Nomenclature](_URL_0_)*. Yes, it's from 1888, and full-blown antiquarian: he catalogues and marvels at the names, rather than performing trenchant cultural-religious analysis as to their purpose and use. (A modern scholar on the topic, for example, would analyze the *snot* out of that Adams quote for what it says about clerics versus laity and popular religious practice  &  morality; Bardsley just drops it in. I'd be supremely interested in an examination of those naming patterns in light of Como's argument about the heterogeneity of puritans in *Blown by the Spirit*). But it's fun and, importantly, free.\n",

      "We present a detailed analysis of the impact of accretion disk winds on the X-ray spectrum of AGN. We find that the most important effects are a reduction of the ionized column density and a removal of the gas pressure in the accretion funnel. This causes the X-ray lines to be broadened and a reduction of the number of ionized atoms along the line-of-sight. We evaluate these effects by comparing our models with observations of the accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN), in particular with observations of the X-ray spectra of low-power AGN (LMXBs and DMXBs) and with observations of the wind-influenced X-ray emission from the microquasars. \n",
      "\n",
      "We find that the impact of accretion disk winds on the X-ray spectrum of a distant observer depends in a non-monotonic way on the ratio of the wind's velocity to the escape velocity of the accretion disk. For the lowest power AGN (LMXBs) the wind has only a small effect on the X-ray lines, while for the highest power AGN (DMXBs) the wind can almost completely remove the X-ray lines. We also find that in the case of the microquasars the observed X-ray line width is in good agreement with the predictions of our model, while the observed X-ray luminosity is somewhat higher than what our model predicts. This can be explained by the fact that in our model the accretion disk is optically thick, while in the microquasars the accretion disk is optically thin. We discuss the observational consequences of our findings.\n",
